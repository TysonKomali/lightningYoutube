### It's a youtube embed player inside a lightning component.

There's just enough CSS to make this full-width fluid responsive, so you don't have to try to manage iframe height/width.

You can use it in AppBuilder, CommunityBuilder, or inside another component that you're building.

attributes/design params are
* video Id
* start time (in seconds)
* end time (in seconds)

Simple, but often needed.
